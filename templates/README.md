# Example template files

Consider these files examples of how developers may integrate Rezfusion components features with an existing theme. _To use
these files you must copy them to your active theme_.

## ```single-vr_listing.php```

Provide an example of using a single "page" for all property details pages. Utilizing a template file to output
the shortcode instead of the WYSIWYG editor makes the system a lot easier to manage.
